# AI Usage Log

## Tools Used
- **Claude Code**
- **ChatGPT**

## Usage Tracking

### Sample Data Creation
- **Used for**: Generating test data for development and testing purposes
- **Why**: Needed varied workout data to test different scenarios without manually creating each entry

### Muscle Enum Generation
- **Used for**: Creating comprehensive `Muscle` enum with all targetable muscle groups
- **Why**: Required exhaustive list of gym-targeted muscles - grunt work to list all muscle groups

### RepRange Data Type Design
- **Used for**: Brainstorming different approaches for modeling rep ranges in workout exercises
- **Why**: Needed to evaluate pros and cons of various implementations (class vs enum vs struct vs string) to make an informed decision

### Exercise Catalog Architecture
- **Used for**: Brainstorming and researching different design patterns for exercise database management
- **Why**: Had multiple implementation approaches in mind but needed help identifying edge cases around catalog versioning, seeding strategies, and handling app updates with new exercises

### Exercise Data
- **Used for**: Collaborating on the ExerciseDetails catalog and generating some target muscles
- **Why**: Combined my provided exercises with AI suggestions to ensure completeness; AI primarily handled the biomechanical analysis to correctly order muscle groups from most to least targeted for the computed arrays

### iOS Technology Research
- **Used for**: Researching modern SwiftUI APIs and patterns
- **Specific topics**:
  - ScrollView modifiers
  - Navigation and toolbar modifiers
- **Why**: Quick reference for recent iOS development patterns and Swift-ful coding

### Documentation
- **Used for**: Creating this AI_USAGE.md file
- **Why**: Document structure and content generation
