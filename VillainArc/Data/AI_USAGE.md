# AI Usage Log

## Tools Used
- **Claude Code**
- **ChatGPT Codex**

## Usage Tracking

### Sample Data Creation
- **Used for**: Generating test data for development and testing purposes
- **Why**: Needed varied workout data to test different scenarios without manually creating each entry

### Muscle Enum Generation
- **Used for**: Creating comprehensive `Muscle` enum with all targetable muscle groups
- **Why**: Required exhaustive list of gym-targeted muscles - grunt work to list all muscle groups

### RepRange Data Type Design
- **Used for**: Brainstorming different approaches for modeling rep ranges in workout exercises
- **Why**: Needed to evaluate pros and cons of various implementations (class vs enum vs struct vs string) to make an informed decision

### Exercise Catalog Architecture
- **Used for**: Brainstorming design patterns and trade-offs for exercise catalog management
- **Why**: AI was used to compare options, list pros/cons, and surface edge cases before coding

### Exercise Seeding + iCloud Edge Cases
- **Used for**: Brainstorming a production-ready seeding approach and iCloud edge cases
- **Why**: AI helped identify risks around catalog updates, renames, and CloudKit timing

### Exercise Data
- **Used for**: Collaborating on the `ExerciseCatalog` list and muscle targeting order
- **Why**: AI assisted with grunt work for muscle ordering and completeness checks

### iOS Technology Research
- **Used for**: Researching modern SwiftUI APIs and patterns
- **Specific topics**:
  - ScrollView modifiers
  - Navigation and toolbar modifiers
- **Why**: Quick reference for recent iOS development patterns and Swift-ful coding

### Documentation
- **Used for**: Creating this AI_USAGE.md file
- **Why**: Document structure and content generation
